\section{Work Distribution}

During the lab, both of us brought in our finished wiring designs from
the output boolean expressions. While we were wiring the circuit, we
ended up splitting the different parts of the wiring between the two
of us, as one person would finish wiring the rails and chip
connections as the other routed the inputs and outputs to their
positions on the breadboard as per our design. For this lab report, we
also split the work. While one person worked on the design and
implementation sections of the report, the other worked on the
testing, introduction, and conclusion.
